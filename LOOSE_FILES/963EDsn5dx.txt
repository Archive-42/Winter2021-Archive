Suppose you're given a binarytree represented as an array.
For example, [3, 6, 2,g, -1, 18] represents the following
binary tree (where -1 is a non-existent node):
6
9
3
2
10
Write a function that determines whether the left or right
branch of the tree is larger. The size of each branch is the
sum of the node values. The function should return the
string "Right" ifthe right side is larger and " Left" ifthe
left side is larger. Ifthe tree has e nodes or if the size of the
branches are equal, return the empty string.
Example Input:
-1,1e]
Example Output:
Left
