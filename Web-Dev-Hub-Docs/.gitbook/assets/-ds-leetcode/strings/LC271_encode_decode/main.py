# Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The
# encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to
# the original list of strings.

# Example
# encoded_string = encode(['kevin', 'is', 'great'])
#                  "5/kevin2/is5/great"

# decoded_array = decode("5/kevin2/is5/great")
#                 ['kevin', 'is', 'great']

# Notes
# - Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your
#   encode and decode should be stateless
# - Do not use an library method such as eval or serialize methods. You
#   must implement your OWN encode and decode algorithm
