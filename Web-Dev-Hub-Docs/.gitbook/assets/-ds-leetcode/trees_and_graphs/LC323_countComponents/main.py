# Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges
# (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number
# of connected components in an undirected graph.

# Example 1:
#  0          3
#  |          |
#  1 --- 2    4
#  Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], return 2.

# Example 2:
#  0           4
#  |           |
#  1 --- 2 --- 3
#  Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]], return 1.
