https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/

The essential thing about level order traversal is the inner for loop over the length of the level.
Above that loop is where you can do any per-level operations. In this case, yielding a copy of the level.
You can use a stack instead of a queue by copying and replacing it on each level.
