# Palindrome is a special string, is same if reversed
# e.g. noon, racecar, et cetera
# Notice in above strings, there is no difference between
# string and it's reversed form

# Function checks if given string is a palindrome or not
# string[::-1] is a clever way to reverse string
# string from start index to end index
# whose difference is -1(reverse)
# found on stack overflow, very pythonic
