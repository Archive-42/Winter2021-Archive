# You are given a sorted array in ascending order that is rotated at some unknown pivot (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]) and a target value.
#
# Write a function that returns the target value's index. If the target value is not present in the array, return -1.
#
# You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
#
# Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
# Output: 4
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
# Output: -1
#
# [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)
#
# [input] array.integer nums
#
# [input] integer target
#
# [output] integer
