Challenge
To implement a delete operation on our BST and BSTNode classes, we must consider three cases:

If the BSTNode to be deleted is a leaf (has no children), we can remove that node from the tree.
If the BSTNode to be deleted has only one child, we copy the child node to be deleted and delete it.
If the BSTNode to be deleted has two children, we have to find the "in-order successor". The "in-order successor" is the next highest value, the node that has the minimum value in the right subtree.
Given the above information, can you write pseudocode for a method that can find the minimum value of all the nodes within a tree or subtree?

- search for the node to find its place in the tree and make sure it exists
- set the parents pointer to it to None if it has no children and set the 
root to none if it is the root node
- if the node has 1 child set the value to its child value and set its 
pointer to none
- find successor or predecessor and copy the value of it to the 
node to be deleted and then we can delete the successor or predecessor

Demo 1

An `image` is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing
the pixel value of the image (from 0 to 65535).
Given a coordinate `(sr, sc)` representing the starting pixel (row and column)
of the flood fill, and a pixel value `newColor`, "flood fill" the image.
To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels
connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the
starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also
with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on. Replace the color of all
of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.
At the end, return the modified image.

Input:
image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
Explanation:
From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels
connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with
the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally
connected to the starting pixel.
```
Notes:
- The length of `image` and `image[0]` will be in the range `[1, 50]`.
- The given starting pixel will satisfy `0 <= sr < image.length` and
`0 <= sc < image[0].length`.
- The value of each color in `image[i][j]` and `newColor` will be an integer in

You are given the root node of a binary search tree (BST).

You need to write a function that returns the sum of values of all the nodes with a value between lower and upper (inclusive).

The BST is guaranteed to have unique values.

Input:
root = [10, 5, 15, 3, 7, null, 18]
lower = 7
upper = 15

Output:

Input:
root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6]

958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree
Medium

14

Add to List

Share
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 1000
