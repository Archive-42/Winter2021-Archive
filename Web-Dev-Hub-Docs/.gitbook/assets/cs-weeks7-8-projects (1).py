Your task is create your own HashTable without using a built-in library.
Your HashTable needs to have the following functions:
- put(key, value) : Inserts a (key, value) pair into the HashTable. If the
value already exists in the HashTable, update the value.
- get(key): Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if
this map contains no mapping for the key.
- remove(key) : Remove the mapping for the value key if this map contains the
mapping for the key.
Example:
```plaintext
hash_table = MyHashTable();
hash_table.put("a", 1);
hash_table.put("b", 2);
hash_table.get("a");            // returns 1
hash_table.get("c");            // returns -1 (not found)
hash_table.put("b", 1);         // update the existing value
hash_table.get("b");            // returns 1
hash_table.remove("b");         // remove the mapping for 2
hash_table.get("b");            // returns -1 (not found)

*** Demo 2 *** 
--------------
You've uncovered a secret alien language. To your surprise, the language is made
up of all English lowercase letters. However, the alphabet is possibly in a
different order (but is some permutation of English lowercase letters).
You need to write a function that, given a sequence of words written in this
secret language, and the order the alphabet, will determine if the given words
are sorted "alphabetically" in this secret language.
The function will return a boolean value, true if the given words are sorted
"alphabetically" (based on the supplied alphabet), and false if they are not
sorted "alphabetically".
Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: words = ["lambda","school"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'l' comes before 's' in this language, then the sequence is
sorted.
```
Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: words = ["were","where","yellow"], order = "habcdefgijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'e' comes after 'h' in this language, then words[0] > words[1],
hence the sequence is unsorted.
```
Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: words = ["lambda","lamb"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first four characters "lamb" match, and the second string is
shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "lambda" > "lamb",
because 'd' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less
than any other character (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order).
```
Notes:
- order.length == 26
- All characters in words[i] and order are English lowercase letters.

Works alone; there are no other spies in the city-state.
You are given a list of pairs, trust. Each trust[i] = [a, b] represents the fact that person a trusts person b.

If the spy exists and can be found, return their identifier. Otherwise, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, trust = [[1, 2]]

Explanation: Person 1 trusts Person 2, but Person 2 does not trust Person 1, so Person 2 is the spy.
