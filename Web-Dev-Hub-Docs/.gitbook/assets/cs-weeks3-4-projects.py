"""
Given an array of integers `nums`, define a function that returns the "pivot" index of the array.
The "pivot" index is where the sum of all the numbers on the left of that index is equal to the sum of all the numbers on the right of that index.
If the input array does not have a "pivot" index, then the function should return `-1`. If there are more than one "pivot" indexes, then you should return the left-most "pivot" index.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The sum of the numbers to the left of index 3 (1 + 7 + 3 = 11) is equal to the sum of numbers to the right of index 3 (5 + 6 = 11).
Also, 3 is the first index where this occurs.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
There is no index that satisfies the conditions in the problem statement.

You are given a non-empty array that represents the digits of a non-negative integer.
Write a function that increments the number by 1.
The digits are stored so that the digit representing the most significant place value is at the beginning of the array. Each element in the array only contains a single digit.
You will not receive a leading 0 in your input array (except for the number 0 itself).

You are given the prices of a stock, in the form of an array of integers, prices. Let's say that prices[i] is the price of the stock on the ith day (0-based index). Assuming that you are allowed to buy and sell the stock only once, your task is to find the maximum possible profit (the difference between the buy and sell prices).

Note: You can assume there are no fees associated with buying or selling the stock.

Example

For prices = [6, 3, 1, 2, 5, 4], the output should be buyAndSellStock(prices) = 4.

It would be most profitable to buy the stock on day 2 and sell it on day 4. Thus, the maximum profit is prices[4] - prices[2] = 5 - 1 = 4.

For prices = [8, 5, 3, 1], the output should be buyAndSellStock(prices) = 0.

Since the value of the stock drops each day, there's no way to make a profit from selling it. Hence, the maximum profit is 0.

For prices = [3, 100, 1, 97], the output should be buyAndSellStock(prices) = 97.

It would be most profitable to buy the stock on day 0 and sell it on day 1. Thus, the maximum profit is prices[1] - prices[0] = 100 - 3 = 97.

A colleague of yours keeps including incorrect JavaScript code in pull
requests. You are getting tired of parsing through their code to make sure
they've included correct brackets, braces, and parentheses.
In order to save yourself time, you decide to write a function that can parse
the code to make sure it includes the correct amount of opening and closing
characters.
We will call `(`, `{`, and `[` "openers".
We will call `)`, `}`, and `]` "closers".
Your input will be a string and your function needs to make sure that there is
a correct number of openers and closers and that they are properly nested.
Examples:
`"{ [ ] ( ) }"` should return `True`
`"{ [ ( ] ) }"` should return `False`
`"{ [ }"` should return `False`
You should be able to do this in one pass with O(n) time and O(n) space
complexity.
*Note: Remember that just making sure that each opener has a corresponding
closer is not enough. You also have to confirm that they are ordered and nested
correctly. For example, "{ [ ( ] ) }" should return False, even though each
opener can be matched to a closer.*

I was bored one day and decided to look at last names in the phonebook for my
area.

perusing. I wrote each last name that I was unfamiliar with down on paper in
increasing order. When I got to the end of the phonebook, I was having so much
fun I decided to start from the beginning and keep going until I reached the
page where I had started.
When I was finished, I had a list of interesting last names that were mostly
alphabetical. The problem was that my list starts somewhere near the middle of
the alphabet, reaches the end, and then starts from the beginning of the
alphabet. In other words, my list of names is sorted, but it is "rotated."

You are a new author that is working on your first book. You are working on a
series of drafts. Each draft is based on the previous draft. The latest draft
of your book has a serious typo. Since each newer draft is based on the
previous draft, all the drafts after the draft containing the typo also include
the typo.
Suppose you have `n` drafts `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` and you need to find out the
first one containing the typo (which causes all the following drafts to have
the typo as well).
You are given access to an API tool `containsTypo(draft)` that will return
`True` if the draft contains a typo and `False` if it does not.
You need to implement a function that will find the *first draft that contains
a typo*. Also, you have to pay a fee for every call to `containsTypo()`, so
make sure that your solution minimizes the number of API calls.
Example:
Given `n = 5`, and `draft = 4` is the first draft containing a typo.
containsTypo(3) -> False
containsTypo(5) -> True
containsTypo(4) -> True

Cookie Monster can eat either 1, 2, or 3 cookies at a time. If he were given a
jar of cookies with `n` cookies inside of it, how many ways could he eat all
`n` cookies in the cookie jar? Implement a function `eating_cookies` that
counts the number of possible ways Cookie Monster can eat all of the cookies in
the jar.
For example, for a jar of cookies with n = 3 (the jar has 3 cookies inside it),
there are 4 possible ways for Cookie Monster to eat all the cookies inside it:
He can eat 1 cookie at a time 3 times
He can eat 1 cookie, then 2 cookies
He can eat 2 cookies, then 1 cookie
He can eat 3 cookies all at once.
Thus, eating_cookies(3) should return an answer of 4.
Can you implement a solution that has a O(n) time complexity and a O(n) space
complexity?
*Note: Since this question is asking you to generate a bunch of possible
permutations, you'll probably want to use recursion for this. Think about base
cases that we would want our recursive function to stop recursing on (when do
you know you've found a "way" to eat the cookies versus when you have not?).*

For word1 = "silent" and word2 = "listen", the output should be
checkBlanagrams(word1, word2) = false.

These two words are anagrams of each other, but no letter substitution was made (the trivial substitution of a letter with itself shouldn't be considered), so they are not blanagrams.
