There are many versions of the knapsack problem. This is one of the simplest that still benefits from
 some form of dynamic programming.
Iterative dynamic programming usually means making a matrix of previous calculations and sub-calculations.
If you only need to access the very last round of calculations (like this problem) you can just use a list.
