# Redux Docs

## Installation

### Redux Toolkit[#](https://redux.js.org/introduction/installation#redux-toolkit)

Redux Toolkit includes the Redux core, as well as other key packages we feel are essential for building Redux applications (such as Redux Thunk and Reselect).

It's available as a package on NPM for use with a module bundler or in a Node application:

```
# NPMnpm install @reduxjs/toolkit
# Yarnyarn add @reduxjs/toolkit
```

Copy

It's also available as a UMD build, which can be loaded from [the `dist` folder on unpkg](https://unpkg.com/@reduxjs/toolkit/dist/). The UMD builds make Redux Toolkit available as a `window.RTK` global variable.

### Redux Core[#](https://redux.js.org/introduction/installation#redux-core)

To install the stable version:

```
# NPMnpm install redux
# Yarnyarn add redux
```

Copy

If you're not, you can [access these files on unpkg](https://unpkg.com/redux/), download them, or point your package manager to them.

Most commonly, people consume Redux as a collection of [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org) modules. These modules are what you get when you import `redux` in a [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), [Browserify](http://browserify.org), or a Node environment. If you like to live on the edge and use [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org), we support that as well.

If you don't use a module bundler, it's also fine. The `redux` npm package includes precompiled production and development [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) builds in the [`dist` folder](https://unpkg.com/redux/dist/). They can be used directly without a bundler and are thus compatible with many popular JavaScript module loaders and environments. For example, you can drop a UMD build as a [`<script>` tag](https://unpkg.com/redux/dist/redux.js) on the page, or [tell Bower to install it](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/pull/1181#issuecomment-167361975). The UMD builds make Redux available as a `window.Redux` global variable.

The Redux source code is written in ES2015 but we precompile both CommonJS and UMD builds to ES5 so they work in [any modern browser](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es5). You don't need to use Babel or a module bundler to [get started with Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples#counter-vanilla).

### Complementary Packages[#](https://redux.js.org/introduction/installation#complementary-packages)

Most likely, you'll also need [the React bindings](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) and [the developer tools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).

```
npm install react-reduxnpm install --save-dev redux-devtools
```

Copy

Note that unlike Redux itself, many packages in the Redux ecosystem don't provide UMD builds, so we recommend using CommonJS module bundlers like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org) for the most comfortable development experience.

### Create a React Redux App[#](https://redux.js.org/introduction/installation#create-a-react-redux-app)

The recommended way to start new apps with React and Redux is by using the [official Redux+JS template](https://github.com/reduxjs/cra-template-redux) or [Redux+TS template](https://github.com/reduxjs/cra-template-redux-typescript) for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which takes advantage of [**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) and React Redux's integration with React components.

```
# Redux + Plain JS templatenpx create-react-app my-app --template redux
# Redux + TypeScript templatenpx create-react-app my-app --template redux-typescript
```

## Core Concepts

Imagine your app’s state is described as a plain object. For example, the state of a todo app might look like this:

```
{  todos: [{    text: 'Eat food',    completed: true  }, {    text: 'Exercise',    completed: false  }],  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED'}
```

Copy

This object is like a “model” except that there are no setters. This is so that different parts of the code can’t change the state arbitrarily, causing hard-to-reproduce bugs.

To change something in the state, you need to dispatch an action. An action is a plain JavaScript object (notice how we don’t introduce any magic?) that describes what happened. Here are a few example actions:

```
{ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Go to swimming pool' }{ type: 'TOGGLE_TODO', index: 1 }{ type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER', filter: 'SHOW_ALL' }
```

Copy

Enforcing that every change is described as an action lets us have a clear understanding of what’s going on in the app. If something changed, we know why it changed. Actions are like breadcrumbs of what has happened. Finally, to tie state and actions together, we write a function called a reducer. Again, nothing magical about it—it’s just a function that takes state and action as arguments, and returns the next state of the app. It would be hard to write such a function for a big app, so we write smaller functions managing parts of the state:

```
function visibilityFilter(state = 'SHOW_ALL', action) {  if (action.type === 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER') {    return action.filter  } else {    return state  }}
function todos(state = [], action) {  switch (action.type) {    case 'ADD_TODO':      return state.concat([{ text: action.text, completed: false }])    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':      return state.map((todo, index) =>        action.index === index          ? { text: todo.text, completed: !todo.completed }          : todo      )    default:      return state  }}
```

Copy

And we write another reducer that manages the complete state of our app by calling those two reducers for the corresponding state keys:

```
function todoApp(state = {}, action) {  return {    todos: todos(state.todos, action),    visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(state.visibilityFilter, action)  }}
```

Copy

This is basically the whole idea of Redux. Note that we haven’t used any Redux APIs. It comes with a few utilities to facilitate this pattern, but the main idea is that you describe how your state is updated over time in response to action objects, and 90% of the code you write is just plain JavaScript, with no use of Redux itself, its APIs, or any magic.

## Ecosystem

Redux is a tiny library, but its contracts and APIs are carefully chosen to spawn an ecosystem of tools and extensions, and the community has created a wide variety of helpful addons, libraries, and tools. You don't need to use any of these addons to use Redux, but they can help make it easier to implement features and solve problems in your application.

For an extensive catalog of libraries, addons, and tools related to Redux, check out the [Redux Ecosystem Links](https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links) list. Also, the [React/Redux Links](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links) list contains tutorials and other useful resources for anyone learning React or Redux.

This page lists some of the Redux-related addons that the Redux maintainers have vetted personally, or that have shown widespread adoption in the community. Don't let this discourage you from trying the rest of them! The ecosystem is growing too fast, and we have a limited time to look at everything. Consider these the “staff picks”, and don't hesitate to submit a PR if you've built something wonderful with Redux.

### Side Effects[#](https://redux.js.org/introduction/ecosystem#side-effects)

**Widely Used#**

[**gaearon/redux-thunk**](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)\
Dispatch functions, which are called and given `dispatch` and `getState` as parameters. This acts as a loophole for AJAX calls and other async behavior.

**Best for**: getting started, simple async and complex synchronous logic.

```
function fetchData(someValue) {    return (dispatch, getState) => {        dispatch({type : "REQUEST_STARTED"});
        myAjaxLib.post("/someEndpoint", {data : someValue})            .then(response => dispatch({type : "REQUEST_SUCCEEDED", payload : response})            .catch(error => dispatch({type : "REQUEST_FAILED", error : error});    };}
function addTodosIfAllowed(todoText) {    return (dispatch, getState) => {        const state = getState();
        if(state.todos.length < MAX_TODOS) {            dispatch({type : "ADD_TODO", text : todoText});        }    }}
```

Copy

[**redux-saga/redux-saga**](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)\
Handle async logic using synchronous-looking generator functions. Sagas return descriptions of effects, which are executed by the saga middleware, and act like "background threads" for JS applications.

**Best for**: complex async logic, decoupled workflows

```
function* fetchData(action) {  const { someValue } = action  try {    const response = yield call(myAjaxLib.post, '/someEndpoint', {      data: someValue    })    yield put({ type: 'REQUEST_SUCCEEDED', payload: response })  } catch (error) {    yield put({ type: 'REQUEST_FAILED', error: error })  }}
function* addTodosIfAllowed(action) {  const { todoText } = action  const todos = yield select(state => state.todos)
  if (todos.length < MAX_TODOS) {    yield put({ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: todoText })  }}
```

Copy

[**redux-observable/redux-observable**](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable)

Handle async logic using RxJS observable chains called "epics". Compose and cancel async actions to create side effects and more.

**Best for**: complex async logic, decoupled workflows

```
const loginRequestEpic = action$ =>  action$    .ofType(LOGIN_REQUEST)    .mergeMap(({ payload: { username, password } }) =>      Observable.from(postLogin(username, password))        .map(loginSuccess)        .catch(loginFailure)    )
const loginSuccessfulEpic = action$ =>  action$    .ofType(LOGIN_SUCCESS)    .delay(2000)    .mergeMap(({ payload: { msg } }) => showMessage(msg))
const rootEpic = combineEpics(loginRequestEpic, loginSuccessfulEpic)
```

Copy

[**redux-loop/redux-loop**](https://github.com/redux-loop/redux-loop)

A port of the Elm Architecture to Redux that allows you to sequence your effects naturally and purely by returning them from your reducers. Reducers now return both a state value and a side effect description.

**Best for**: trying to be as much like Elm as possible in Redux+JS

```
export const reducer = (state = {}, action) => {  switch (action.type) {    case ActionType.LOGIN_REQUEST:      const { username, password } = action.payload      return loop(        { pending: true },        Effect.promise(loginPromise, username, password)      )    case ActionType.LOGIN_SUCCESS:      const { user, msg } = action.payload      return loop(        { pending: false, user },        Effect.promise(delayMessagePromise, msg, 2000)      )    case ActionType.LOGIN_FAILURE:      return { pending: false, err: action.payload }    default:      return state  }}
```

Copy

[**jeffbski/redux-logic**](https://github.com/jeffbski/redux-logic)

Side effects lib built with observables, but allows use of callbacks, promises, async/await, or observables. Provides declarative processing of actions.

**Best for**: very decoupled async logic

```
const loginLogic = createLogic({  type: Actions.LOGIN_REQUEST,
  process({ getState, action }, dispatch, done) {    const { username, password } = action.payload
    postLogin(username, password)      .then(        ({ user, msg }) => {          dispatch(loginSucceeded(user))
          setTimeout(() => dispatch(showMessage(msg)), 2000)        },        err => dispatch(loginFailure(err))      )      .then(done)  }})
```

Copy

**Promises#**

[**acdlite/redux-promise**](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-promise)\
Dispatch promises as action payloads, and have FSA-compliant actions dispatched as the promise resolves or rejects.

```
dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_DATA', payload: myAjaxLib.get('/data') })// will dispatch either {type : "FETCH_DATA", payload : response} if resolved,// or dispatch {type : "FETCH_DATA", payload : error, error : true} if rejected
```

Copy

[**lelandrichardson/redux-pack**](https://github.com/lelandrichardson/redux-pack)\
Sensible, declarative, convention-based promise handling that guides users in a good direction without exposing the full power of dispatch.

```
dispatch({type : "FETCH_DATA", payload : myAjaxLib.get("/data") });
// in a reducer:        case "FETCH_DATA": =            return handle(state, action, {                start: prevState => ({                  ...prevState,                  isLoading: true,                  fooError: null                }),                finish: prevState => ({ ...prevState, isLoading: false }),                failure: prevState => ({ ...prevState, fooError: payload }),                success: prevState => ({ ...prevState, foo: payload }),            });

## Examples

Redux is distributed with a few examples in its [source code](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples). Most of these examples are also on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io), an online editor that lets you play with the examples online.

### Counter Vanilla[#](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples#counter-vanilla)

Run the [Counter Vanilla](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/counter-vanilla) example:

```
git clone https://github.com/reduxjs/redux.git
cd redux/examples/counter-vanillaopen index.html
```

Copy

Or check out the [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/counter-vanilla):

It does not require a build system or a view framework and exists to show the raw Redux API used with ES5.

### Counter[#](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples#counter)

Run the [Counter](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/counter) example:

```
git clone https://github.com/reduxjs/redux.git
cd redux/examples/counternpm installnpm start
```

Copy

Or check out the [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/counter):

This is the most basic example of using Redux together with React. For simplicity, it re-renders the React component manually when the store changes. In real projects, you will likely want to use the highly performant [React Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) bindings instead.

This example includes tests.

### Todos[#](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples#todos)

Run the [Todos](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos) example:

```
git clone https://github.com/reduxjs/redux.git
cd redux/examples/todosnpm installnpm start
```

Copy

Or check out the [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos):

This is the best example to get a deeper understanding of how the state updates work together with components in Redux. It shows how reducers can delegate handling actions to other reducers, and how you can use [React Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) to generate container components from your presentational components.

This example includes tests.

### Todos with Undo[#](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples#todos-with-undo)

Run the [Todos with Undo](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos-with-undo) example:

```
git clone https://github.com/reduxjs/redux.git
cd redux/examples/todos-with-undonpm installnpm start
```

Copy

Or check out the [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos-with-undo):

{% embed url="https://codesandbox.io/s/adoring-cherry-qyvkw" %}

This is a variation on the previous example. It is almost identical, but additionally shows how wrapping your reducer with [Redux Undo](https://github.com/omnidan/redux-undo) lets you add a Undo/Redo functionality to your app with a few lines of code.

### TodoMVC[#](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples#todomvc)

Run the [TodoMVC](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc) example:

```
git clone https://github.com/reduxjs/redux.git
cd redux/examples/todomvcnpm installnpm start
```

Copy

Or check out the [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc):

{% embed url="https://codesandbox.io/s/gallant-sun-wx9oc" %}

This is the classical [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) example. It's here for the sake of comparison, but it covers the same points as the Todos example.

This example includes tests.

### Shopping Cart[#](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples#shopping-cart)

Run the [Shopping Cart](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/shopping-cart) example:

```
git clone https://github.com/reduxjs/redux.git
cd redux/examples/shopping-cartnpm installnpm start
```

Copy

Or check out the [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/shopping-cart):

{% embed url="https://codesandbox.io/s/nervous-glitter-4dm0n" %}

This example shows important idiomatic Redux patterns that become important as your app grows. In particular, it shows how to store entities in a normalized way by their IDs, how to compose reducers on several levels, and how to define selectors alongside the reducers so the knowledge about the state shape is encapsulated. It also demonstrates logging with [Redux Logger](https://github.com/fcomb/redux-logger) and conditional dispatching of actions with [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) middleware.

### Tree View[#](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples#tree-view)

Run the [Tree View](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/tree-view) example:

```
git clone https://github.com/reduxjs/redux.git
cd redux/examples/tree-viewnpm installnpm start
```

Copy

Or check out the [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/tree-view):

{% embed url="https://codesandbox.io/s/eloquent-babbage-pd1uu" %}

This example demonstrates rendering a deeply nested tree view and representing its state in a normalized form so it is easy to update from reducers. Good rendering performance is achieved by the container components granularly subscribing only to the tree nodes that they render.

This example includes tests.

### Async[#](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples#async)

Run the [Async](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/async) example:

```
git clone https://github.com/reduxjs/redux.git
cd redux/examples/asyncnpm installnpm start
```

Copy

Or check out the [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/async):

{% embed url="https://codesandbox.io/s/boring-panini-klj2m" %}

This example includes reading from an asynchronous API, fetching data in response to user input, showing loading indicators, caching the response, and invalidating the cache. It uses [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) middleware to encapsulate asynchronous side effects.

### Universal[#](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples#universal)

Run the [Universal](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/universal) example:

```
git clone https://github.com/reduxjs/redux.git
cd redux/examples/universalnpm installnpm start
```

Copy

This is a basic demonstration of [server rendering](https://redux.js.org/usage/server-rendering) with Redux and React. It shows how to prepare the initial store state on the server, and pass it down to the client so the client store can boot up from an existing state.

### Real World[#](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples#real-world)

Run the [Real World](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/real-world) example:

```
git clone https://github.com/reduxjs/redux.git
cd redux/examples/real-worldnpm installnpm start
```

Copy

Or check out the [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/real-world):

{% embed url="https://codesandbox.io/s/distracted-mcclintock-fsoqr" %}

This is the most advanced example. It is dense by design. It covers keeping fetched entities in a normalized cache, implementing a custom middleware for API calls, rendering partially loaded data, pagination, caching responses, displaying error messages, and routing. Additionally, it includes Redux DevTools.
