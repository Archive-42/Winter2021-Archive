# Backend

### **What is Backend Development?**

As mentioned above, backend development is what keeps the internet running behind the scenes.

Backend developers are primarily focused on how a website works. They write code that focuses on the functionality and logic powering the application they‚Äôre working on, and the technology they work on is never directly seen by users. &#x20;

The [tech of the back end](https://www.careerexplorer.com/careers/back-end-developer/) is a combination of servers, applications, and databases.

Responsibilities of backend programmers could involve writing APIs, writing code to interact with a database, creating libraries, working on business processes and data architecture, and much more. It often depends on the specific role and company.

### **Front-end Vs Backend Programming**

Intuitively, the other side of backend development is the front end.&#x20;

The key difference is that while backend developers build how a website functions, front-end programmers build and design the interface, determining how the site looks to users.&#x20;

Backend web development [lays the foundational code](https://www.roberthalf.com/blog/salaries-and-skills/what-is-the-best-programming-language-for-your-backend-developer-career) that enables websites to process the actions that users take on the front end and deliver the correct information in return.

Neither works without the other‚Äîyou need the back end to make the front end work, and you need the front end so people can actually access and interact with the website.&#x20;

Backend developers typically earn higher salaries than front-end developers, as backend languages tend to be more technical. The average salary for a backend developer is [$101,619/yr](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/backend-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,17.htm), while front-end developers earn [$76,929/yr](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/front-end-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,19.htm).

There are also full-stack developers, who can work with both backend and front-end technologies. They‚Äôre the jack-of-all-trades of the programming world.

### Types of Backend Development Languages

Backend programming can either be **object-oriented (OOP) **or **functional**.

The former is the technique that focuses on the creation of objects. With object-oriented programming, statements should be executed in a particular order. Popular OOP languages are **Java**, **.NET**, and **Python**,

The latter is a technique that is more ‚Äúaction‚Äù-based. Functional programming uses declarative language, which means that statements can be executed in any order. It‚Äôs commonly used for [data science](https://learntocodewith.me/learn/data-science/), and popular languages are **SQL**, **F#**, and **R**.

Languages can either be** statically typed** or **dynamically typed. **The former is more rigid, but better at catching errors, whereas the latter is more flexible but allows for variables to change types (which could account for unexpected errors). This article by [Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/i-finally-understand-static-vs-dynamic-typing-and-you-will-too-ad0c2bd0acc7) goes into greater detail if you‚Äôre interested in finding out more.

### 7 Popular Backend Programming Languages

Now, let‚Äôs take a look at some specific backend development languages and what they‚Äôre used for.

#### Backend Language #1: Java <a href="java" id="java"></a>

Java is the world‚Äôs [most popular](https://www.codingdojo.com/blog/7-most-in-demand-programming-languages-of-2018/) programming language‚Äîand for good reason. Not only is Java extremely versatile (its use spans from smartphones to smart cards); it has also been used by developers for over 20 years.

What makes Java so versatile is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). With many development languages, compiling a program creates code that may run differently if the computers it‚Äôs run on are different. This is not an issue for Java because of the JVM. The Java Virtual Machine acts like a middle layer that can run code on any computer, regardless of where the said code was compiled.

While Java is extremely popular with desktop and business software developers, it is less beginner-friendly than a language like Python. This is because it‚Äôs verbose and requires more code to build out features; as a result, it‚Äôs less rewarding to those just starting out.

That said, Java‚Äôs longstanding popularity and varied use mean that its community is large. Consequently, any questions you may have about the language will likely have forum threads and online tutorials dedicated to answering it.

**üí° WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH JAVA**

#### Backend Language #2: PHP <a href="php" id="php"></a>

[PHP](http://php.net) powers [78.2% of all websites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php/all/all) whose server-side programming language we know. The language was first released in 1995 when there were few options for building dynamic websites.

![PHP](https://learntocodewith.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/PHP.jpg)

Since PHP is dynamically typed, it means you‚Äôre able to come up with a variety of solutions and workarounds for one problem. It also means that the same bit of code can mean something different depending on the context, which makes programs written in PHP tricky to scale and sometimes slow to run.

PHP is a [great language to learn](https://learntocodewith.me/go/goskills-intro-php/) for those who are just starting out for a number of reasons:

- It‚Äôs more forgiving of errors, which means that you‚Äôre able to compile and run a program until you reach a problematic part.
- There is an abundance of resources dedicated to the language as a result of the large community and tool support. The language undergoes updates, so ensure you‚Äôre learning from an up-to-date tutorial.
- The setup is relatively easy compared to a language like Ruby on Rails. You can download [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) (for Macs) or WAMP ([for Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/)) and you should be ready to go in 5 minutes.

**üí° WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH PHP**

According to the [PHP website](http://php.net/manual/en/intro-whatcando.php), you can:&#x20;

- Collect form data
- Generate dynamic page content
- Send and receive cookies
- Write command line scripting
- Write server-side scripting
- Write desktop applications

**üíº COMPANIES THAT USE PHP üíº**

Here are some [companies using PHP](https://stackshare.io/php) in their dev teams:

- Facebook
- Lyft
- Mint
- Hootsuite
- Viber
- Buffer
- DocuSign

**üíµ AVERAGE SALARY FOR PHP DEVELOPERS üíµ**

As of [April 2020](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/php-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,13.htm), PHP developers made an average of $82,007/year in the US, with salaries ranging from $55k to $100k.

#### Backend Language #3: .NET (C#, VB) <a href="net-vb" id="net-vb"></a>

[ASP.NET](https://www.asp.net) is Microsoft‚Äôs answer to Sun Microsystem‚Äôs (now, Oracle) Java. The web application framework is used to build websites using languages like Visual Basic (VB), C#, F#, and more.

Its MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern allows backend development duties to be handled by a controller, which interacts with a model to process data. The result is then presented to the view for display as a frontend web page.

Made open source in 2016, .NET can integrate with iOS, Linux, and Android by way of .NET Core. The code is highly stable and reliable, making it a popular choice for businesses. Because it is a Microsoft product, there is great support available if you ever get lost.

**C#**

C# is a high-level computer language, which means it allows developers to write programs that are [independent of a particular type of computer](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/H/high_level_language.html). Languages like these write and read more like human languages rather than machine languages.

C# is popular among developers because it has the power of C++ (another backend language) but is easier to use because it error-proofs commands that tend to trip up C++ users.

Programmers on Stack Overflow have praised the language for its ‚Äúcool syntax.‚Äù

**VB**

VB is a programming language that uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to [modify code written in the BASIC programming language](https://searchwindevelopment.techtarget.com/definition/Visual-Basic). It‚Äôs an easy language to start with because of its straightforward syntax and its widespread use. As a result, it‚Äôs often used for prototyping.

The drawback of coding with VB is the large amount of memory required to install and run GUI-based development tools.

**üí° WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH .NET**

- Build desktop applications
- Create mobile apps
- Build web applications and games
- Work with Big Data
- And more

![Backend programming languages](https://learntocodewith.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/programming-language.jpg)

**üíº COMPANIES THAT USE .NET**

A few of the [companies using .NET](https://stackshare.io/dot-net) as a programming language:

- Microsoft

#### **Backend Language #4: Ruby** <a href="ruby" id="ruby"></a>

[Ruby on Rails](https://learntocodewith.me/go/goskills-ruby-rails/) (or Ruby) is a web development language built on top of the Ruby programming language. Ruby on Rails has a set of tools that allow you to simply create basic tasks (e.g. you‚Äôre able to create a basic blog with one line of code).

Ruby involves little backend work, enabling developers to create and launch applications quickly. It is similar to Python in that it‚Äôs fantastic for prototyping. Ruby grew in popularity in the early 2000s as a result but has declined since then.

Ruby is open source, which means it can be modified and built upon.

**üí° WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH RUBY**

- Automate repetitive tasks
- Build web applications&#x20;
- Build mobile applications and games
- Create prototypes
- And more

**üíº COMPANIES THAT USE RUBY**

#### Backend Language #5: Python <a href="python" id="python"></a>

There‚Äôs a reason [Python](https://learntocodewith.me/go/goskills-python/) is the [fastest-growing programming language](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/which-is-the-fastest-growing-programming-language-hint-its-not-javascript/). The versatile language is used for both web and desktop development. Like with Java, there are plenty of tutorials and guides online, making it an accessible language for those just starting out.

Furthermore, its syntax is simple and easy to understand compared to other backend languages. Those who program with Python have lauded it for its ‚Äúelegant,‚Äù ‚Äúreadable,‚Äù and ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù code on Stack Overflow.

![Reasons to learn Python as a backend developer](https://learntocodewith.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Python.jpg)

As mentioned above, Ruby and Python share similarities. They are both dynamically typed, open source, and object-oriented languages. The key differences between the two are the differences in popularity (Ruby is declining whereas Python is skyrocketing) and the tools in Ruby‚Äôs language.

[Learn about the differences between Python 2 and Python 3 here.](https://learntocodewith.me/programming/python/python-2-vs-python-3/)

#### Backend Language #6: SQL <a href="sql" id="sql"></a>

Structured Query Language or [SQL](https://learntocodewith.me/go/goskills-sql/) (pronounced ‚Äòsequel‚Äô) is the most common query language. SQL is used to interact with databases.

SQL is great for beginners to learn since it‚Äôs a declarative language. A declarative language allows coders to ‚Äòdeclare‚Äô the results they would like to see, without specifying the steps or process for said result.

A query language like SQL is great for those who want to take advantage of the wealth of knowledge stored in databases.

[Learn more about SQL in the LTCWM guide.](https://learntocodewith.me/posts/sql-guide/)

**üí° WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH SQL**

SQL is used to access, manipulate, and create databases.

Those who work closely with data can benefit from learning SQL. This includes financial analysts, data-driven marketers, or online entrepreneurs. SQL is an ideal stepping stone for those who want to dive into the world of Big Data. For some inspiration, here is a list of jobs that use SQL the most.

**üíº COMPANIES THAT USE SQL**

Since SQL is a query language, its use is broad and widespread. If a company or enterprise has a database, it is extremely probable that they are using SQL to query it.

**üíµ AVERAGE SALARY OF SQL DEVELOPERS**

As of [April 2020](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/sql-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,13.htm), SQL developers made an average of $81,622/year in the US, with salaries ranging from $61k to $130k.

#### Backend Language #7: JavaScript <a href="javascript" id="javascript"></a>

Not to be confused with [Java](https://learntocodewith.me/posts/java-for-beginners/), [JavaScript](https://learntocodewith.me/learn/javascript/) is a language that can be used for both the front end and back end.

It‚Äôs a great language for beginners because it is a higher-level language and there is little setup involved (you can start coding in your browser).![JavaScript - another backend programming language](https://learntocodewith.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/JavaScript.jpg)

Because the language is so flexible, objects created in this language are slow. It is also difficult to maintain and scale, as with most dynamically typed languages.

Having said that, the language is ubiquitous, which means the community is large‚Äîaffording you a slew of resources and plenty of opportunities for employment if you know JavaScript backend technologies.
