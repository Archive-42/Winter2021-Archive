## Dictionary <a id="fc34"></a>

A [dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset) contains mapping information of \(key, value\) pairs. Given a key, the corresponding value can be found in the dictionary. It’s also one of Python’s built-in types. The \(key, value\) pairs can be dynamically added, removed, and modified. A dictionary also allows iteration through the keys, values, and \(key, value\) pairs.Python code for operations on a dictionary
