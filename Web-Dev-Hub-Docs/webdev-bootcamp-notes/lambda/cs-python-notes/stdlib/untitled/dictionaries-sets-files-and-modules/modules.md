# Modules

### Modules

#### What is a Module

A module is a file containing a set of codes or a set of functions which can be included to an application. A module could be a file containing a single variable, a function or a big code base.

#### Creating a Module

To create a module we write our codes in a python script and we save it as a .py file. Create a file named mymodule.py inside your project folder. Let us write some code in this file.

```python
# mymodule.py file
def generate_full_name(firstname, lastname):
    return firstname + ' ' + lastname
```

Create main.py file in your project directory and import the mymodule.py file.

#### Importing a Module

To import the file we use the _import_ keyword and the name of the file only.

```python
# main.py file
import mymodule
print(mymodule.generate_full_name('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh')) # Asabeneh Yetayeh
```

#### Import Functions from a Module

We can have many functions in a file and we can import all the functions differently.

```python
# main.py file
from mymodule import generate_full_name, sum_two_nums, person, gravity
print(generate_full_name('Asabneh','Yetayeh'))
print(sum_two_nums(1,9))
mass = 100;
weight = mass * gravity
print(weight)
print(person['firstname'])
```

#### Import Functions from a Module and Renaming

During importing we can rename the name of the module.

```python
# main.py file
from mymodule import generate_full_name as fullname, sum_two_nums as total, person as p, gravity as g
print(fullname('Asabneh','Yetayeh'))
print(total(1, 9))
mass = 100;
weight = mass * g
print(weight)
print(p)
print(p['firstname'])
```

### Import Built-in Modules

Like other programming languages we can also import modules by importing the file/function using the key word _import_. Let's import the common module we will use most of the time. Some of the common built-in modules: _math_, _datetime_, _os_,_sys_, _random_, _statistics_, _collections_, _json_,_re_

#### OS Module

Using python _os_ module it is possible to automatically perform many operating system tasks. The OS module in Python provides functions for creating, changing current working directory, and removing a directory \(folder\), fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory.

```python
# import the module
import os
# Creating a directory
os.mkdir('directory_name')
# Changing the current directory
os.chdir('path')
# Getting current working directory
os.getcwd()
# Removing directory
os.rmdir()
```

#### Sys Module

The sys module provides functions and variables used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment. Function sys.argv returns a list of command line arguments passed to a Python script. The item at index 0 in this list is always the name of the script, at index 1 is the argument passed from the command line.

Example of a script.py file:

```python
import sys
#print(sys.argv[0], argv[1],sys.argv[2])  # this line would print out: filename argument1 argument2
print('Welcome {}. Enjoy  {} challenge!'.format(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2]))
```

Now to check how this script works I wrote in command line:

```bash
python script.py Asabeneh 30DaysOfPython
```

The result:

```bash
Welcome Asabeneh. Enjoy  30DayOfPython challenge!
```

Some useful sys commands:

```python
# to exit sys
sys.exit()
# To know the largest integer variable it takes
sys.maxsize
# To know environment path
sys.path
# To know the version of python you are using
sys.version
```

#### Statistics Module

The statistics module provides functions for mathematical statistics of numeric data. The popular statistical functions which are defined in this module: _mean_, _median_, _mode_, _stdev_ etc.

```python
from statistics import * # importing all the statistics modules
ages = [20, 20, 4, 24, 25, 22, 26, 20, 23, 22, 26]
print(mean(ages))       # ~22.9
print(median(ages))     # 23
print(mode(ages))       # 20
print(stdev(ages))      # ~2.3
```

#### Math Module

Module containing many mathematical operations and constants.

```python
import math
print(math.pi)           # 3.141592653589793, pi constant
print(math.sqrt(2))      # 1.4142135623730951, square root
print(math.pow(2, 3))    # 8.0, exponential function
print(math.floor(9.81))  # 9, rounding to the lowest
print(math.ceil(9.81))   # 10, rounding to the highest
print(math.log10(100))   # 2, logarithm with 10 as base
```

Now, we have imported the _math_ module which contains lots of function which can help us to perform mathematical calculations. To check what functions the module has got, we can use _help\(math\)_, or _dir\(math\)_. This will display the available functions in the module. If we want to import only a specific function from the module we import it as follows:

```python
from math import pi
print(pi)
```

It is also possible to import multiple functions at once

```python
from math import pi, sqrt, pow, floor, ceil, log10
print(pi)                 # 3.141592653589793
print(sqrt(2))            # 1.4142135623730951
print(pow(2, 3))          # 8.0
print(floor(9.81))        # 9
print(ceil(9.81))         # 10
print(math.log10(100))    # 2
```

But if we want to import all the function in math module we can use \* .

```python
from math import *
print(pi)                  # 3.141592653589793, pi constant
print(sqrt(2))             # 1.4142135623730951, square root
print(pow(2, 3))           # 8.0, exponential
print(floor(9.81))         # 9, rounding to the lowest
print(ceil(9.81))          # 10, rounding to the highest
print(math.log10(100))     # 2
```

When we import we can also rename the name of the function.

```python
from math import pi as  PI
print(PI) # 3.141592653589793
```

#### String Module

A string module is a useful module for many purposes. The example below shows some use of the string module.

```python
import string
print(string.ascii_letters) # abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
print(string.digits)        # 0123456789
print(string.punctuation)   # !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
```

#### Random Module

By now you are familiar with importing modules. Let us do one more import to get very familiar with it. Let us import _random_ module which gives us a random number between 0 and 0.9999.... The _random_ module has lots of functions but in this section we will only use _random_ and _randint_.

```python
from random import random, randint
print(random())   # it doesn't take any arguments; it returns a value between 0 and 0.9999
print(randint(5, 20)) # it returns a random integer number between [5, 20] inclusive
```
