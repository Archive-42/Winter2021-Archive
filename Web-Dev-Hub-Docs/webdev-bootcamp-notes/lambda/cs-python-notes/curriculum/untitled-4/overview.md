# Outline-W-19

### Overview <a id="overview"></a>

During this sprint, we will introduce you to some very common data structures: linked lists, queues, stacks, and binary trees. Additionally, we will teach you about searching through these data structures.

A basic understanding of and the ability to work with these data structures is crucial. These are probably the most common data structures you work with, and an excellent working understanding of them is essential for you to pass a technical interview.

### Linked Lists <a id="linked-lists"></a>

In this module, you will learn all about linked lists. This a crucial data structure because they form the basis for many other data structures.

### Queues and Stacks <a id="queues-and-stacks"></a>

This module will teach about queues, stacks, and different implementation options for both. The queue and stack data structures come up frequently during technical interviews and form the basis for necessary traversal techniques that we will look at later.

### Binary Search Trees <a id="binary-search-trees"></a>

In this module, you will learn about binary tree properties and binary search trees. These data structures commonly come up during technical interviews, so you need to be comfortable working with them.

### Tree Traversal <a id="tree-traversal"></a>

In this module, you will learn about the different tree traversal methods and practice using them in algorithmic code challenges.
