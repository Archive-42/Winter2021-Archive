## big ‘O’ notation <a id="5fc8"></a>

- Big O Notation is a tool for describing the efficiency of algorithms with respect to the size of the input arguments.
- Since we use mathematical functions in Big-O, there are a few big picture ideas that we’ll want to keep in mind:
- The function should be defined by the size of the input.
- `Smaller` Big O is better \(lower time complexity\)
- Big O is used to describe the worst case scenario.
- Big O is simplified to show only its most dominant mathematical term.

## Simplifying Math Terms <a id="6083"></a>

- We can use the following rules to simplify the our Big O functions:
- `Simplify Products` : If the function is a product of many terms, we drop the terms that don't depend on n.
- `Simplify Sums` : If the function is a sum of many terms, we drop the non-dominant terms.
- `n` : size of the input
- `T(f)` : unsimplified math function
- `O(f)` : simplified math function.

- First we apply the product rule to drop all constants.
- Then we apply the sum rule to select the single most dominant term.

## Computing Big O

Brian "Beej Jorgensen" Hall edited this page on Nov 4, 2019 · [9 revisions](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Wiki/wiki/Computing-Big-O/_history)

Goal: determine how runtime/number of operations scales up as the input scales up. How much longer does it take to run as the size of the data to process gets bigger?

### Steps to compute Big O

- Things in sequence that _aren't_ loops add together
- A single thing inside a loop gets multiplied by the loop

1. Go a line at a time, only looking at lines that are executable
2. Add all the things in sequence that you can first
3. Then multiply by the loops
4. Then repeat steps 2-3 as many times as you can
5. Then keep the dominant term from the resulting sum\(s\)
6. Then drop constants

### Hints

- If you have something that's `O(number_of_elements_in_the_data)`, we use `n` as shorthand for `number_of_elements_in_the_data`, so `O(n)`.
- Individual statements tend to be `O(1)`.
- Loop statements tend to be `O(how-many-times-they-loop)`.
- Anything that doubles the runtime each step is `O(2^n)` \(e.g. naive Fibonacci\).
- Anything that triples the runtime each step is `O(3^n)`.
- Anything that halves the runtime each step is `O(log n)` \(e.g. binary search\).
- By _dominant term_ we mean, "thing which is largest given some large value of _n_, like 10000". `O(n)` dominates `O(1)`. `O(n^2)` dominates `O(n)` and `O(1)`.
- Loops that iterate over entire lists are `O(n)`, where `n` is the size of the list.
- But loops that binary search over a list are `O(log n)`!

### Recursion

- Recursive functions are like loops, where the body of the function is the body of the loop.
- You need to figure out how many times the function will call itself, and that's the Big O that you need to multiply against the Big O of the function body.
- Keep in mind that recursion comes with an inherent memory cost that loops don't incur, since each recursive call adds an additional execution frame to the stack; in other words, calling a function is not free!

### Gotchas

- Built in functions might incur significant Big O without you noticing. Python's list `.copy()` might seem like just a simple `O(1)` line, but [it's `O(n)` under the hood](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity).
- Beware of loops that modify their index in weird ways.

### Example

Label all statements by their time complexities. Individual statements get their Big O, while loops get the number of times they loop.

```python
def foo(n):
    a = 10                # O(1)
    b = 20                # O(1)

    for i in range(n):    # O(n)
        a += b               # O(1)
        b += 1               # O(1)

    for j in range(n**2): # O(n^2)
        a -= 2               # O(1)
        print(a)             # O(1)

        for k in range(n/2): # O(n/2)
            print(k)             # O(1)

    return a + b          # O(1)
```

Now we'll replace the lines of code with their Big O for brevity:

```python
def foo(n):
    # O(1)
    # O(1)

    # O(n)
        # O(1)
        # O(1)

    # O(n^2)
        # O(1)
        # O(1)

        # O(n/2)
            # O(1)

    # O(1)
```

Try to add things in sequence, but remember that loops interrupt sequences!

```python
def foo(n):
    # O(2)    -- was O(1) + O(1)

    # O(n)
        # O(2)    -- was O(1) + O(1)

    # O(n^2)
        # O(2)    -- was O(1) + O(1)

        # O(n/2)
            # O(1)

    # O(1)
```

Now we see if we can multiply any loops by their bodies.

```python
def foo(n):
    # O(2)

    # O(2 * n)    -- had body O(2)

    # O(n^2)      -- can't do this one yet--body has more than one item
        # O(2)

        # O(1 * n/2)    -- had body O(1)

    # O(1)
```

Let's try to add any sequences again.

```python
def foo(n):
    # O(2 + 2 * n)

    # O(n^2)
        # O(2 + 1 * n/2)

    # O(1)
```

Now let's try multiplying loops again

```python
def foo(n):
    # O(2 + 2 * n)

    # O(n^2 * (2 + 1 * n/2))

    # O(1)
```

Add add sequences again:

```python
def foo(n):
    # O((2 + 2 * n) + (n^2 * (2 + 1 * n/2)) + 1)
```

Now we're down to one line. That's the time complexity, but we need to reduce it.

Break out your algebra.

```python
(2 + 2 * n) + (n^2 * (2 + 1 * n/2)) + 1   From the Big O, above
2 + 2 * n + n^2 * (2 + 1 * n/2) + 1       Lose unnecessary parens
3 + 2 * n + n^2 * (2 + 1 * n/2)           Add some like terms
3 + 2 * n + n^2 * (2 + n/2)               1* is does nothing
3 + 2 * n + 2 * n^2 + n/2 * n^2           Distribute n^2
3 + 2 * n + 2 * n^2 + 1/2 * n * n^2       Note the n/2 is 1/2*n
3 + 2 * n + 2 * n^2 + 1/2 * n^3           n * n^2 = n^3
(3) + (2 * n) + (2 * n^2) + (1/2 * n^3)   Choose the most dominant from the sum
1/2 * n^3                                 1/2 * n^3 grows fastest, is dominant
n^3                                       Drop the constant
```

`O(n^3)` is the time complexity of this function.

With practice, you can do this in your head. Looking back, the nested loop _must_ have been where the function spent the most of its time; an experienced dev would see that and just quickly compute the Big O for that function from that nested loop alone.

### Example with two variables

```python
def foo(m, n):
    for i in range(m * n):
        print(i)
```

When you have two inputs like this, there's no way to reduce it farther than `O(m*n)` \(or `O(n*m)`, same thing\). That's the answer.

Sometimes when `m` and `n` tend to be roughly similar, developers will casually say this is `O(n^2)`, but it's really `O(m*n)`.

### Example with lists

```python
def foo(x):  # x is a list
    for i in x:    # O(n)
        print(i)       # O(1)
```

In this example, we're not explicitly passing in an `n` parameter, but rather a list.

The list has a number of elements in it, and we refer to this number as `n` by default.

The `for` loop is therefore `O(n)`, because it will iterate one time for each element in the list.

Another example:

```python
def foo(x, y):  # x and y are lists
    for i in x:    # O(n)
        for j in y:    # O(m)
            print(i, j)    # O(1)
```

Here we've used `n` to represent the number of elements in list `x`, and `m` to represent the number in list `y`.

We can use our simplification rules and see that the entire function is `O(n*m*1)`, or `O(n*m)`. \(Or `O(n^2)` if we're speaking informally, and assuming that `n` and `m` are very similar.\)

### Example with trivial recursion

```python
def foo(x):   # x is a list
    if len(x) == 0:
        return

    print(x[0])
    foo(x[1:])
```

The above function prints out every element in a list. But it's trickier to see what the Big O is. Our normal rules don't work entirely well.

The secret is that recursive functions are like loops on steroids. So you know it's similar to a loop in that it's going to perform a number of operations. But how many? `n`? `n^2`? We have to figure it out.

In the above example, each call to `foo()` results in _one_ more call to `foo()`. \(Because we look in the body of the function and we see it only calls itself once.\) And it's going to keep calling itself a number of times. _How many times will `foo()` call itself?_

Here, if we declare that `n` is the number of elements in list `x`, `foo()` calls itself `n` times, once for each element in `x`.

So the recursion itself, acting like a loop, is `O(n)`.

We still have to look at the things _inside_ `foo()` to see what else is going on. The body of `foo()` becomes like the body of the loop.

But it looks like in there we only have a couple `O(1)` things, so the whole thing becomes `O(n * (1 + 1))`, aka `O(2n)` AKA `O(n)`. Final answer.

### Example with Fibonacci

```python
def fib(n):   # Give me the nth Fibonacci number
    if n < 2:
        return n

    return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)  # Calls itself twice per call!
```

Again, think loop on steroids. `fib()` calls itself... but it calls itself _two_ times per call. ..._ish_.

We call it `1` time, it calls itself `2` times. Those `2` times call it `4` times, which call it `8` times, which call it `16` times, etc. If you recognize those numbers, you'll know those are powers of 2. `2^0=1`, `2^1=2`, `2^2=4`, `2^3=8`, and all the way up to `2^n`.

This is an `O(2^n)` recursive call. \(With an `O(1)` body.\)

Sure, `fib(n-2)` only calls it `1/2 * n` times, but we chuck that constant for Big O.

And the base case won't necessarily let `n` get all the way down to zero, but those are just some `-1`s or `-2`s, and those terms aren't dominant in Big O.
