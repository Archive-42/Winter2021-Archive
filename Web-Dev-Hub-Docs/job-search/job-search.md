## How we interview

We look for people who are excellent at their craft and want to share that expertise with others. Regardless if you're an engineer, designer, marketer, or a wildcard, we want to see that your fundamentals are nailed down, you're resourceful, responsive to feedback, and able to think on your toes!\
\
That means that we won't be testing you with brainteasers that are unrelated to the real world. We ask you questions related to real challenges at Replit.\
\
We are always looking for new talent and value everyone who wants to contribute— from fulltime to interns.
