**Understanding variables**

​ Variables are simply declarations that are used to store certain values. For instance, the variable `name` can hold the value of `John Smith.` Several rules need to be considered when declaring variable names. For starters, a variable name cannot begin with a number. ​ `2name = incorrect #incorrect` ​ `name = correct #correct` ​ Variable names are case sensitive. This means that the variable `school` is not the same as `School`. ​ Variables can hold different data types. This includes strings, integers, Booleans, long, lists, and arrays. ​ In Python, we do not need to declare the data type while writing a variable. This is because the code is compiled and interpreted later. The compiler will throw an error in case there is a mismatch in the data types. ​ Let’s talk about the different data types. ​ 1. Strings ​ Strings are usually presented in a text format. We will declare a string variable, as shown below. ​

```
name = “john”school = “Alliance Francaise”
```

​ When we run `print(name)`, the output will be `john`. ​ 1. Integers ​ These variables hold numeric values, as shown below. ​

```
math = 90chemistry = 100biology = 70
```

​ We can find the total of the variables above using the following statement. ​

```
print(math+chemistry+biology)
```

​ The total is `260`. ​ A TypeError is thrown when you try to add a string to an integer, as shwon below. ​

```
var1 = "30" #stringvar2 = 20 #integer​print(var1+var2)#type error
```

​ We can sum `var1` and `var2` by converting `var1` to an integer using the `int()` function. The following code will execute successfully. ​

```
var1 = "30" #stringvar2 = 20 #integer​print(int(var1)+var2) # Output: 50
```

​

> Make sure that the variable stores a value that can be converted to an integer before using the int() method. ​ 1. Booleans ​ There are only two Boolean values: `True` and `False`. In other words, something can either be true or false. We declare these values, as shown below. Please note that Python is case sensitive. ​
>
> ```
> isOn = TrueisChecked = False
> ```
>
> ​ A `bool()` method can help convert a value to a boolean. The code snippets below showcase how a `bool()` function can be used. ​
>
> ```
> print(bool("abc")) #returns Trueprint(bool(0))  #returns False
> ```
>
> ​ The `bool()` function returns False when there are no parameters. ​ 1. Float ​ This data type consists of numbers that have a decimal place. A perfect example of a float variable is highlighted below. ​
>
> ```
> Bmi = 45.7
> ```
>
> ​
>
> **Understanding lists**
>
> ​ Lists allow us to store numerous elements in a particular variable. For instance, we can have a list that stores all the student names in a class. We use `[]` to define a list. ​
>
> ```
> students = [] #list example
> ```
>
> ​ Elements in a list are usually separated by a comma, as shown below. ​
>
> ```
> students = [“john”, “Mary Thomas”, “John Smith”]
> ```
>
> ​ Each element in the above `students` list has an index. By default, the first index is 0. So the item at index \[0] is `john`, while the value at index `1` is `Mary Thomas`. A list of integers will look as follows. ​
>
> ```
> student_marks = [90, 78, 90, 78]
> ```
>
> ​ We can access different list functionalities using built-in functions. For instance, to add a value to the `student_marks` list, we use the `append` function. ​
>
> ```
> student_marks.append("Guardian Angel")print(student_marks)
> ```
>
> ​ The above function adds `Guardian Angel` at the end of the `student_marks` list. ​ When we print the list it shows: ​
>
> ```
> #output[90, 78, 90, 78, 'Guardian Angel']
> ```
>
> ​ We use `len(student_marks)` to determine the length of the list. We use the `remove()` function to delete something from the list. For instance, we can remove `90` from the `student_mark` list as shown below. ​
>
> ```
> student_marks.remove(90)print(student_marks)
> ```
>
> ​ In lists, negative indices allow us to count elements starting from the last one. For instance, the element with an index of `-1` in the above `student_marks` list is `"Guardian Angel"`. The second last element `78` has an index of `-2`. ​
>
> **Understanding functions or methods**
>
> ​ Methods are quite critical in programming. They help store reusable code. This means that a person can call already declared methods rather than writing statements from scratch repeatedly. This saves significant time, that can be invested in other productive activities. ​ In Python, we use the `def` keyword to declare a function. An example of a python method is shown below. ​
>
> ```
> def readData():    print('success')
> ```
>
> ​ The above function prints `success` when it’s invoked. We can also pass data to a method, perform some calculations, and return the results. This is demonstrated in the code snippet below. ​
>
> ```
> def calculateTotal(chem, bio):    return chem+bio​print(calculateTotal(90,80))
> ```
>
> ​ The `calculateTotal` method takes in two parameters (chem, bio). The function then returns the sum of the two values. It is important to take note of the data types when passing parameters. For instance, the `calculateTotal` method will not work when we pass in a string as a parameter. This is because the program cannot sum up an integer and a string. As shown above, we can call the `calculateTotal` method directly from our print statement. ​
>
> ```
> print(calculateTotal(90,80))
> ```
>
> ​ The `return` keyword ensures that the method returns a result after execution. ​ Note that a function can also call another method. This is illustrated below. ​
>
> ```
> def readData(chem, bio):    return chem+bio​def getTotal():    print(readData(90,80)) #calls the readData method​getTotal()
> ```
>
> ​
>
> **Understanding loops**
>
> ​ Loops are critical because they allow us to iterate through lists, check for different conditions, and continuously execute various statements. The main loops are `for` and `while`. ​ 1. For loops As noted, we can use a for loop to iterate through a list, as shown below: ​
>
> ```
> student_list = [“John Doore”,”Matu Smith”]for x in student_list:    print(x)
> ```
>
> ​ The `for` loop above will print every item in the student\_list. ​ 1. While loops A while loop can help us check for a particular condition. For instance, while something is true specific statements can be executed. Here is an example of a while loop in action. ​
>
> ```
> isChecked = falsewhile isChecked == true:    print('Hallo there')
> ```
>
> ​ Note that the while loop above will be executed indefinitely until isChecked is set to false. You can press ctrl+c to stop the loop. ​
>
> **Classes**
>
> ​ Classes are a vital component of object-oriented programming. When creating a class, you must use the `class` keyword. Other elements are then nested in the class. Here is an example of a Python class. ​
>
> ```
> class Farmer: # a class with the name farmer    name = "John" # A variable    produce = "1000kgs" # A variable​farmer = Farmer() #instatiating the class as an object. print(farmer.name) # accessing the properties of the Farmer class.
> ```
>
> ​ Classes can help as group things with similar characteristics. We can also assign values to class variables using the `init` function. ​
>
> ```
> class Farmer:  def __init__(self, farmername, produce):    self.farmername = farmername    self.produce = produce​farmer = Farmer("Carry Sminson", "10,000kgs")​print(farmer.farmername, farmer.produce)
> ```
>
> ​ In the above `Farmer` class, the `self` keyword represents an instance of an object. In other words, it allows us to access the different methods and attributes defined in the class. ​ You can also declare a method in a class and use it later, as shown below. ​
>
> ```
> class Farmer:  def __init__(self, farmername, produce):    self.farmername = farmername    self.produce = produce​  def printDetails(self): # Method      print(self.farmername, self.produce)​farmer = Farmer("Carry Sminson", "10,000kgs")​farmer.printDetails()
> ```

> ​ Remember, there is a difference between integers and strings. _Remember: String =_ _`""`._ To convert between these two, you can put an int in a `str()` function, and a string in a `int()` function.

>     Python has created a lot of functions that are located in other .py files. You need to import these **modules** to gain access to the,, You may wonder why python did this. The purpose of separate modules is to make python faster. Instead of storing millions and millions of functions, , it only needs a few basic ones. To import a module, you must write `input <modulename>`. Do not add the .py extension to the file name. In this example , we will be using a python created module named random.

>     The _PMT-Challenge_ is no different! Now how do we break it down, and where do we really start? Once again, your common sense will reveal a solution. As a first step, we could get the computer to calculate say, `5 * 3`. The second thing we can do, is to try and print the calculated value, in a manner similar to `5 * 3 = 15`. Then, we could repeat what we just did, to print out all the entries of the `5` multiplication table. Let’s put it down a little more formally:

>
>       ​

>       `5 + 6 + 10` is an example of an expression. In this expression, `5`, `6` and `10` are operands. The `+` here is the operator. You can have multiple operators in an expression. We also did mention that the operands, namely `10`, `6` and `5`, are literals. Their values will not change.

>
>       ​
>
>       Think about what would happen when you do something of this kind: `5 $ 2`. You’re right, it would throw a `SyntaxError`. When Python does not understand the code you type in, it reports an error. Here, the expression we’re typing is `5 $ 2`, which does not make sense to Python, hence the `SyntaxError`.

>       ```
>
>       ​
>
>       Let’s say we type in `5+6+10`, without any spaces between the operands, and the operators. What do you think will happen? Surprisingly, the Python Shell does calculate the value!

>       ```
>       >> 5+6+10    21
>       ```
>
>       ​
>
>       In an expression, using spaces makes it easier for you to read it, but it’s not mandatory. `5 + 6 + 10` is easier to read than `5+6+10`, but does not make any difference to the Python compiler.
>
>       ​
>
>       The next puzzle tries to evaluate `5 / 2`, which is “`5` divided by `2`”. What would be the output? `2.5`.

>       >> 5/2    2.5

>
>       If you’re coming from other programming languages like Java or C, this might be a surprising result. If you try this in Java for instance, you would get `2` as the output. Note that even though both operands are integers, the result of the `/` operation is a floating point value, `2.5` . Python does what is expected by a programmer!
>
>       ​
>
>       The puzzle after that tries to play with `5 + 5 * 6`. What would be the result of this expression? Will it be `5 + 5` or `10`, then `10 * 6`, which is `60`? Or, will it be `5` plus `5 * 6`, which is `5` + `30`, that’s `35`?

>     ​
>
>     Let’s try another small puzzle on precedence, with `5 - 2 * 2`. What would be the result of this? Will it be `6`, or `1`? It’s `1`, because `*` has a higher precedence than `-`. Thus `2 * 2` is `4`, and `5 - 4` gives us `1`.

There are some interesting, and useful ways of using a combination of both, within the same string. Have a look at this call: `print("Hello'World")`, and notice the output we get. In a similar way, the following code will be accepted and run by the Python system: `print('Hello"World')`.

Here, `2` is an integer value, but `2.5` is a floating point value. You can see that it prints `2.5 * 2 = 5.0`. So this approach of formatting values with `print()`, works also with floating point data as well.

However, Python uses indentation to identify which code is part of a `for` loop, and which is not. So if we are writing the body of a `for` loop, we must use indentation, and leave atleast a single `<SPACE>`.

>
>     ​
> * `1`, `11`, `5`, … are all called literals because these are constant values. Their values don’t really change. \_Consider ``5 _ 4 _ 50`. This is an expression. `_`is an operator, and`5`, `4`and`50`` are operands.
> * The name `i` in `i = 1`, is called a variable. It can refer to different values, at different points in time.
> * `range()` and `print()` are in-built Python functions.
> * Every complete line of code is called statement. The specific statement `print()`, is invoking a method. The other statement which we looked at earlier, was an assignment statement. `index = index + 1` would evaluate `index + 1`, and have the `index` variable refer to that value.
> *   The syntax of the `for` loop was very simple. `for var in range(1, 10) : ...`, followed by statements you would want to execute in a loop, with indentation. For the sake of indentation we left four `<SPACE>`s in front of each statement inside the `for` loop.

>
>       ​
>
>       With `print_hello_world(5)`, you can see `"Hello World"` and `5` being printed. We are now able to define this method to accept a value, and print that value by invoking it. You can pass in any value, such as`10`, `100`, or others.

>
>       Something you need to always be cautious about in Python, is the indentation. Over here, the `for` loop is part of the method body. So we have extra indentation for it. The print is part of the `for` loop body. So guess what, even more indentation for that code.

>     A simple rule of thumb is, if you have a parameter, you can pass any type of data to it. That could be an integer, a floating point value a string, or a boolean value. The Python language does not check for the type of a parameter. However, Python will throw an error if the function which is using that parameter, expects it to be of a specific type. The `range()` function expects that the `no_of_times` is an integer value.
