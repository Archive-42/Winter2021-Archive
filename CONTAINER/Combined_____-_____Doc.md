/*
Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.
Implement the LRUCache class:
LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.
Follow up:
Could you do get and put in O(1) time complexity?
 
Example 1:
Input
["LRUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4]
Explanation
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4
 
Constraints:
1 <= capacity <= 3000
0 <= key <= 3000
0 <= value <= 104
At most 3 * 104 calls will be made to get and put.

  Amazon Fresh Promo (example question)

  Amazon is running a promotion in which customers receive prizes for purchasing a secret combination of fruits. The combination will change each day, and the team running the promotion wants to use a code list to make it easy to change the combination. The code list contains groups of fruits. Both the order of the groups within the code list and the order of the fruits within the groups matter. However, between the groups of fruits, any number, and type of fruit is allowable. The term "anything" is used to allow for any type of fruit to appear in that location within the group.

  Consider the following secret code list: [[apple, apple], [banana, anything, banana]]
  Based on the above secret code list, a customer who made either of the following purchases would win the prize:
  orange, apple, apple, banana, orange, banana
  apple, apple, orange, orange, banana, apple, banana, banana

  Write an algorithm to output 1 if the customer is a winner else output 0.

  Input
  The input to the function/method consists of two arguments:
  codeList, a list of lists of strings representing the order and grouping of specific fruits that must be purchased in order to win the prize for the day.
  shoppingCart, a list of strings representing the order in which a customer purchases fruit.

  Output
  Return an integer 1 if the customer is a winner else return 0.

  Note
  'anything' in the codeList represents that any fruit can be ordered in place of 'anything' in the group. 'anything' has to be something, it cannot be "nothing."
  'anything' must represent one and only one fruit.
  If secret code list is empty then it is assumed that the customer is a winner.

  Example 1:

  Input: codeList = [[apple, apple], [banana, anything, banana]] shoppingCart = [orange, apple, apple, banana, orange, banana]
  Output: 1
  Explanation:
  codeList contains two groups - [apple, apple] and [banana, anything, banana].
  The second group contains 'anything' so any fruit can be ordered in place of 'anything' in the shoppingCart. The customer is a winner as the customer has added fruits in the order of fruits in the groups and the order of groups in the codeList is also maintained in the shoppingCart.

  Example 2:

  Input: codeList = [[apple, apple], [banana, anything, banana]]
  shoppingCart = [banana, orange, banana, apple, apple]
  Output: 0
  Explanation:
  The customer is not a winner as the customer has added the fruits in order of groups but group [banana, orange, banana] is not following the group [apple, apple] in the codeList.

  Example 3:

  Input: codeList = [[apple, apple], [banana, anything, banana]] shoppingCart = [apple, banana, apple, banana, orange, banana]
  Output: 0
  Explanation:
  The customer is not a winner as the customer has added the fruits in an order which is not following the order of fruit names in the first group.

  Example 4:

  Input: codeList = [[apple, apple], [apple, apple, banana]] shoppingCart = [apple, apple, apple, banana]
  Output: 0
  Explanation:
  The customer is not a winner as the first 2 fruits form group 1, all three fruits would form group 2, but can't because it would contain all fruits of group 1.

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
Clarification:
Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
Internally you can think of this:
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbers 0 and 1 respectively. All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.
The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in a stack. At each step:
If the student at the front of the queue prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.
Otherwise, they will leave it and go to the queue's end.
This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.
You are given two integer arrays students and sandwiches where sandwiches[i] is the type of the i​​​​​​th sandwich in the stack (i = 0 is the top of the stack) and students[j] is the preference of the j​​​​​​th student in the initial queue (j = 0 is the front of the queue). Return the number of students that are unable to eat.
 
Example 1:
Input: students = [1,1,0,0], sandwiches = [0,1,0,1]
Output: 0 
Explanation:
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,0,0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,0,1,1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [0,1,1] and sandwiches = [1,0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,1,0].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [1,0] and sandwiches = [0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [1] and sandwiches = [1].

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
Clarification:
Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
Internally you can think of this:
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.

Output: 2, nums = [1,2]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]

  Amazon Customer Reviews (example question)

  Amazon is building a way to help customers search reviews quicker by providing real-time suggestions to search
  terms when the customer starts typing. When given a minimum of two characters into the search field the system
  will suggest at most three keywords from the review word repository. As the customer continues to type in the reviews
  search bar the relevant keyword suggestions will update automatically.

  Write an algorith that will output a maximum of three keyword suggestions after each character is typed by the customer 
  in the search field.
  If there are more than three acceptable keywords, return the keywords that are first in alphabetical order.
  Only retun keyword suggestions after the customer has entered two characters.
  Keyword suggestions must start with the characters already typed Both the respository and the customerQuery should be
  compared in a case-insensitive way.

  Input 
  The input to the method/function consists of two arguments: repository, a list of unique strings representing the
  various keywords from the amazon review comment section;
  customerQuery, a string representing the full search query of the customer.

  Output
  Return a list of a list of strings in lower case, where each list represents the keyword suggestions made by the
  system as the customer types each character of the customerQuery. Assume the customer types characters in order
  without deleting or removing any characters. If an output is not possible, return an empty array([]).

  Example 

  Input: 
  repository = ['mobile', 'mouse', 'moneypot', 'monitor', 'mousepad']
  customerQuery = 'mouse'

  output:
  ['mobile', 'moneypot', 'monitor']
  ['mouse', 'mousepad']
  ['mouse, 'mousepad']
  ['mouse, 'mousepad']

  Explanation 
  The chain of words that will generate in the search box will be mo, mou, mous, mouse
  and each line from output shows the suggestion of 'mo', 'mou','mous','mouse', respectively in each line.
  For the keyword suggestions made by the system that are generated for 'mo', the matches that will be generated are:
  ['mobile, 'mouse', 'moneypot','monitor','mousepad']
  Alphabetically, they will be reorderd to [mobile, moneypot, monitor, mouse, mousepad]
  Thus the keyword suggestions made by the system are [mobile, moneypot, monitor]

   * Complete the 'searchSuggestions' function below.
   *
   * The function is expected to return a 2D_STRING_ARRAY.
   * The function accepts following parameters:
   *  1. STRING_ARRAY repository
   *  2. STRING customerQuery

Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).
The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:
Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
Read in next the characters until the next non-digit charcter or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. "123" -> 123, "0032" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
Return the integer as the final result.
Note:
Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
